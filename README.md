# 👋 Welcome to **Manmohit’s Hackyards**

![Hackyards Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackyards-Learn%20&%20Experiment-blue?style=for-the-badge)

This is my **secondary GitHub account** dedicated to **learning, practice, and experimentation**.  
Here, I explore new technologies, work on tutorial projects, and build clones of what I learn — all in a safe “hackyard” environment.

## 🧪 Why “Hackyards”?

The name **Hackyards** reflects a **developer’s backyard workshop** — a place where I can:

- 🔧 Experiment freely without worrying about perfection  
- 🔍 Break and rebuild projects to **understand them better**  
- 📚 Practice by cloning tutorials, courses, and guides  

In short, it’s a **space for learning, testing, and improving skills** — a true “developer playground.”

## 💻 What you’ll find here

- 📖 **Tutorial-based projects & clones** — reproducing what I learn from videos, courses, and guides  
- 🏋️ **Practice exercises** — small programs to reinforce concepts  
- ⚡ **Experimental code** — testing new frameworks, tools, or ideas  
- 🧠 **Learning-focused experiments** — mistakes are part of the process  

> All projects here are part of my **learning journey**. They might not be production-ready but reflect **hands-on practice and growth**.
