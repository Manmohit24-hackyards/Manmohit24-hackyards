<h1 align="center">👋 Welcome to <strong>Manmohit’s Hackyards</strong></h1>

<p align="center"><em style="color:gray;">“Where code gets messy, tutorials get cloned, and ideas get tested 🧠💥”</em></p>

This is my **secondary GitHub account** for **learning, practice, and experimentation**.  

***Hackyards? A developer's backyard :)***  
Here, I **experiment**, **break things**, and **rebuild projects** while working through tutorials.  
It’s my safe space to get messy and learn new skills without worrying about perfection.
